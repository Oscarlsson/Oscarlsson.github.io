</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>I gave a <em>introduction to clustering</em> at the Machine Learning meetup-group here in Gothenburg with 35 Machine Learning-enthusiasts, in a wide range of ML-experience, participating.</p>
<p>We, Spotify, hosted the meetup at our Gothenburg office and I gave two presentations on roughly 30 minutes each. The first one was a theoretical introduction to clustering and feature engineering.
The purpose of the presentation was to first build an intuition of what clustering is (and what it isn't) by pedagogically explaining the steps from getting the data to the output of the algorithm.</p>
<p>And, as I'm really excited about the Machine Learning-community in Python I demoed some data mining in Python. Showing of the use-everyday-libraries such as Numpy, Pandas and Scikit-learn and tie it together with the theoretical methods I had already explained. The clustering examples I did were on Music Lyric data scraped from a lyrics Wikipedia. I showed how we easily could pre-process (clean / vectorize) the data and then plug it into our clustering algorithms. As problem of clustering is unsupervised hence hard to evaluate I (think) managed to show a typical work flow when doing Machine Learning on real-world data. There were tons of obvious preprocessing steps I skipped, but I did so to not add to much to the presentation but to make it easy to follow.</p>
<p>And I must say that I enjoyed talking to all of you attending the event both in the break and afterwards. I noticed that most participated to meet and discuss Machine Learning with others and I'm glad we got the chance to do so.</p>

</div><!-- /.post-info --><p>As a master student majoring in Machine Learning I've tried to research what
companies and institutions in Gothenburg that is involved in Machine Learning/Big data/Data analysis. I was
looking for future work place and trying to understand how the community in GBG worked.</p>
<p>I thought I would share what I've found.
This list is probably not complete and I would love to add information about your company or 
research group as well as update or change the information given below.
The Machine Learning community in Gothenburg is not big which partly motivates this summary. </p>
<h1>The community</h1>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://karinabunyik.com">Karina Bunyik</a>, started a meetup group for Machine Learning Gothenburg <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Goteborg-Machine-Learning-Meetup/">found here</a> that I'm now co-organizing.
There will be seminars introducing the basics of Machine Learning and hopefully presentations from the industry on applications.</p>
<p>Sadly, that it is besides what Chalmers offers. The ML group at the Computer Science department is called LAB and announces seminars on this <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/lab/seminars.php">link</a>. I find
it useful to skim once a month or so.
Not to long ago LAB helped arrange a <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/lab/seminars.php?sid=25">Seminar on Big Data</a> at Chalmers indicating that the community is growing.</p>
<h1>Chalmers</h1>
<p>Chalmers offers a couple of interesting courses. Nothing in data mining but some in statistics and theoretical ML.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/lab/courses.php?coid=9">Algortihms for Machine Learning</a></li>
<li><a href="http://physics.gu.se/~frtbm/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=99&amp;catid=79&amp;Itemid=290A">Neural Networks</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.math.chalmers.se/Stat/Grundutb/GU/MSA100/A13/">Computer Intensive Statistical Methods</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/year/2013/course/TIN171/">Artificial Intelligence</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/lab/courses.php?coid=8">OLD: Decision Making Under uncertainty</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/lab/courses.php?coid=4">OLD: Boosting</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>Industry</h1>
<h3>Recorded Future</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Recorded Future is a startup company headquartered in Cambridge, MA with offices in Arlington, VA and Gothenburg, Sweden. Their team includes computer scientists, statisticians, linguists, and technical business people with deep expertise in areas such as intelligence and security. They`re committed to organizing the web in a radically new and useful way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have heard, and seen job ads, indicating them looking for Data Scientists and Machine Learning engineers. Their dataset contains billions of texts and the tool they are developing is a way to analyze it.</p>
<p>I know they have had collaborations with Chalmers LAB group in exchanging data.</p>
<p>Jobs here: <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/jobs/">RF</a></p>
<h3>Findwise</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Findwise uses search technology to increase your data quality. Our motto is "right information, to the right person, at the right time".  We have had over 300 successful project in different industries and areas:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, as Recorded Future they have had collaborations with Chalmers LAB group.</p>
<p>On their website they announce that they are looking for thesis students in Machine Learning <a href="http://career.findwise.com/jobs/2110-thesis">here</a>. I recall one thesis-description including experimenting with word2vec.</p>
<h3>Burt</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Burt provides intelligence and analytics to digital publishers, 
turning big data into insight, action and revenue. Our platform is built to support digital media owners, rather than online marketing 
and e-commerce. We combine detailed media measurement, powerful big data capabilities and beautiful data visualizations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Compared to the two previous companies Burt is a pure startup in company culture. It is hard to understand how they are using Machine Learning but they seem to be running A/B-tests and use some type of large NoSQL-database for their 700TB data. That indicates to me that they are one of few interesting companies to mention in a summary as this.</p>
<p>An old thesis of a evaluation of storage of large data can be found <a href="http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/123839.pdf">here</a> and 2014 this thesis was announced <a href="https://farmchalmers.files.wordpress.com/2014/02/thesis_work_original_a4.pdf">link</a></p>
<h3>Tajitsu</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Tajitsu is a predictive customer analytics platform for progressive marketing teams. We help companies find high-value customers, and keep them coming back. Tajitsu turns data into results!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tajitsu is focusing on helping Casino-companies understand their data. Meaning that they build Machine Learning-models they selll business-to-business.
No job advertisements out but they are looking for Machine Learning engineers.</p>
<h3>Aitellu</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Aitellu delivers Insight Analytics of Big data to give you information detecting anomalies and nascent trends, helping you to act on the things that make a difference.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heavily connected with Tajitsu as the people behind Tajitsu left Aitellu to start their own business. One of the algortihms used at  Aitellu is a so called evolutionary algortihm.
As for jobs: they where looking for <a href="http://www.wannaremote.com/utvecklare-at-aitellu-technologies-ab-gothenburg-sweden-allows-remote/">python-developer with knowledge in AI</a></p>
<h3>Dreamler</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Dreamler's mission is to enable people to experience true efficiency and constant improvement, across all projects. Our product harnesses the competitiveness, speed, and seamless teamwork of multiplayer games to realize your biggest ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure what data Dreamler has but this blog post indicates that they are at least interested in Machine Learning <a href="http://blog.dreamler.com/machine-learning-in-dreamler/">http://blog.dreamler.com/machine-learning-in-dreamler/</a></p>
<h3>Spotify</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Music streaming service</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spotify do have an office in Gothenburg, but no team focusing on Machine Learning. The recommender system-team is located in NYC and former EchoNest in Boston. However, I'm working as a Data Engineer (in Gothenburg) doing data analysis on our large dataset from a performance perspective.</p>
